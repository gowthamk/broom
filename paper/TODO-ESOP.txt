* Change static semantics to use method precondition, without class precondition
* update abstract/intro to stress aspects of constraint solver
======
* proof of lemma 4 (abduction decomposition)
* Include op semantics back, after reformatting/splitting?
* constraint gen rules: tywf: for arrow type: rho-bar not-in constraint!

? Notation: should we use a different notation to distinguish a validity constraint from actual entailment?
======
  cleanup: syntax of constraints (region-constraint, validity constraint, etc.) and later usage (abduction constraint)
  \item adjust spacing in RULEs
  \item for function-calls: need basic typing from core language to introduce region parameters
  \item discuss computation of least-solution to constraints?
  \item equality is shorthand for two inequalities
  \item use of alpha-renaming, and its use to discharge not-in contraints;
\item also remind reader that variable names are unique
  \item Note that we can also clarify that the well-formedness constraints are
    syntactic sugar from basic set constraints
  \item Prove: Progress: Every region-variable will be unified with some constant.
======
  \item explain: non-determinism in defining region-variable binding is immaterial.
  \item explain lemma 2's use case (a) and (b)
  \item notation: decomposable is dependent on C
