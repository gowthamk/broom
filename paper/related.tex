Tofte and Talpin in~\cite{tofte93,tofte94,tofte97} introduce the
concept of a region type system to statically enforce the safety of
their region-based memory management scheme in ML. Following their
seminal work, static type systems for safe region-based memory
management have been extensively studied in the context of various
languages and problem settings~\cite{cyclone02, cyclone04, yates99,
MIT03, DPJ09, HMN01, WW01, rust, gpu14}. Our work differs from the
existing proposals in a number of ways. Firstly, our problem setting
includes lexically scoped stack regions and dynamic transferable
regions (both programmer-managed) in context of an object-oriented
programming language equipped with higher-order functions. Second, we
adopt a two-pronged approach to memory safety that relies on a
combination of a simple static type discipline and lightweight runtime
checks. 
% The type system reduces the problem of ensuring safety of all memory
% accesses in a program into a problem of enforcing a state-transition
% discipline on memory accesses over a small subset of objects in the
% program. The later can be done efficiently at runtime. This lets us
% guarantee safety in presence of
In particular, our approach requires neither restrictive static
mechanisms (e.g., linear types and unique pointers) nor expensive
runtime mechanisms (e.g., garbage collection and reference counting)
in order to guarantee safety. Lastly, our region type system comes
equipped with full type inference that more or less eliminates the
need to write region annotations on types to convince the type checker
that the program is safe. 

~\cite{tofte97} proposes to extend Standard ML, a higher-order
functional language, with lexically-scoped stack regions, and defines
an elaboration from Standard ML to the region-annotated version of
Standard ML. The aim of the elaboration is to introduce stack regions
and do away with GC in a transparent fashion without jeopardizing
memory safety. We too define an elaboration, but our focus is on
introducing region annotations necessary to prove the safety of an
object-oriented program that already uses (stack and dynamic) regions.
% Similar to their region inference algorithm, our region type inference
% algorithm can deal with region-polymorphic recursion by computing
% fixed points for recursive constraints. 
Our type inference is analogous to their region inference. While their
inference algorithm only ever generates equality constraints, which
can be solved via unification, our type inference algorithm also
generates partial order outlives constraints, which are required to
capture subtle relationships between lifetimes of transferable regions
and stack regions. Consequently, our constraint solving algorithm is
more sophisticated, and is capable of inferring unknown outlives
constraints over region arguments of polymorphic recursive functions.

Cyclone~\cite{cyclone02} equips C with programmer-managed stack
regions, and a typing discipline that statically guarantees the safety
of all pointer dereferences. However, types need to be written
explicitly. While some region annotations can be inferred, type
inference is purely intraprocedural, and cannot infer region types for
functions. Later proposal~\cite{cyclone04} extends Cyclone with
dynamic regions, but has to impose unique pointer restrictions to
guarantee safety. Objects that need to be shared within data
structures are allowed to have multiple references, and safety for
such objects was ensured via runtime reference counting.

An ownership type system for safe region-based memory management in
real-time Java has been proposed by~\cite{MIT03}.  
% Like us, they too assume a source language with programmer-managed
% memory regions, and focus on proving safety of programs written in
% that language.  
Their source language admits various kinds of regions with
lexically-scoped lifetimes (i.e., stack regions) in order to support
shared-memory concurrency. In contrast, we admit regions with
dynamically determined lifetimes in order to support message-passing
concurrency. We borrow outlives relation from their formal
development, and our type system bears some similarities to theirs.
However, our language also admits parametric polymorphism (generics)
and higher-order functions.
%, whose interaction is non-trivial in context of a region type system. 
% On the other hand, our type system eschews the notions of region kinds
% and ownership, leading to a more succinct formalization. 
Furthermore, we establish type safety and transfer safety results that
formalize the guarantees provided by our system. While ~\cite{MIT03}'s
language is explicitly typed, our language comes equipped with full
type inference.

% type inference, region types for methods and classes need to be

~\cite{HMN01} proposes a flow-sensitive region-based memory management
for first-order programs that proposes to overcome some of the
drawbacks of~\cite{tofte97} by generalizing~\cite{tofte97}'s approach
to regions with dynamic lifetimes. However, dynamic regions are still
not first-class values of the language, and reference counting is
nonetheless needed to ensure memory safety.~\cite{WW01} extends lambda
calculus with first-class regions with dynamic lifetimes, and imposes
linear typing to control accesses to regions. Our open/close lexical
block for transferable regions traces its orgins to the \C{let!}
expression in~\cite{WW01} and~\cite{wadler90} that safely relaxes
linear typing restrictions, allowing variables to be temporarily
aliased. We don't have linear typing, thus admit unrestricted
aliasing. Non-linear typing keeps our type system simple, and makes it
possible to infer types, thus eliminating the annotation burden.
Moreover, ~\cite{WW01}'s linear type system is insufficient to enforce
the invariants needed to ensure safety under region transfers, such as
the absence of references that escape a transferable region.

The idea of using region-based memory management to facilitate the
safe transfer of rich data structures between computational nodes has
been previously explored by~\cite{gpu14} in the context of Scheme
language. However, their setting only includes lexically-scoped
regions for which Tofte and Talpin-style analysis~\cite{tofte97}
suffices. In contrast, our language provides first-class support for
transferable regions with dynamic lifetimes. We require this
generality in order to support streaming query operators, such as the
one shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:motivating-eg}.
