Recent work in high-performance 
systems written in managed languages 
(such as Java or C\#) has shown that garbage-collection can be a
significant performance bottleneck.  A class of these
systems, focused on big-data, create many and often large data-structures with
well-defined lifetimes.  In this paper, we present a language and
memory management scheme based on user-managed memory regions (called
\emph{transferable regions}) that allow programmers to exploit
knowledge of data-structures' lifetimes to achieve significant
performance improvements.

Manual memory management is susceptible to the usual perils of
dangling pointers.  A key contribution of this paper is a region type
system that ensures the memory safety of C\# programs in the presence
of transferable regions. We compliment our type system with a type
inference algorithm that infers principal region types for first-order
programs, and useful types for higher-order programs. This eliminates
the need for programmers to write region annotations on types, while
facilitating the reuse of existing C\# libraries with no
modifications. Experiments demonstrate the practical utility of our
approach.

%As a testament to efficacy of our approach, we demonstrate performance
%improvements over a range of realistic dataflow programs that were
%rewritten to use region-based manual memory management, but are
%nevertheless judged to be safe by our type system.
