Recent work in high-performance systems written in managed languages (such as Java or C\#) has shown
that garbage-collection can be a significant performance bottleneck in such systems.
A class of these systems, focused on big-data, create huge data-structures with well-defined lifetimes.
In this paper, we present a language and memory management scheme based on user-managed
memory regions (called \emph{transferable regions}) that allow programmers to exploit
knowledge of data-structures' lifetimes to achieve significant performance improvements.

Manual memory management is susceptible to the usual perils of dangling pointers.
A key contribution of this paper is a region type system that
ensures the memory safety of region-annotated C\# programs,
even in presence of higher-order stateful functions. We
also present a type inference algorithm that infers principal region types
for first-order programs, eliminating the need for programmers to write
region annotations on types. Our inference algorithm is also very
effective, albeit incomplete, for higher-order programs.

%As a testament to efficacy of our approach, we demonstrate performance
%improvements over a range of realistic dataflow programs that were
%rewritten to use region-based manual memory management, but are
%nevertheless judged to be safe by our type system.
