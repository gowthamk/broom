% Recent work in high-performance systems written in managed languages
% (such as Java or C\#) has shown that garbage-collection can be a
% significant performance bottleneck.
% A class of these systems, focused on big-data, create numerous large
% data structures with well-defined lifetimes.
%
There is increasing interest in alternative memory management techniques
that strike a balance between the convenience of garbage collection and
the better performance that manual memory management enables, without
compromising safety.
%
In this paper, we present a language and a memory
management scheme based on user-managed memory regions (called
\emph{transferable regions}) that allow programmers to exploit the
knowledge of data structures' lifetimes to improve performance.

Manual memory management is susceptible to the usual perils of
dangling pointers. A key contribution of this paper is a
refinement-based region type system that ensures the memory safety of
C\# programs in the presence of transferable regions.
We complement our type system with a type inference algorithm.
This eliminates the need for programmers to write region annotations on types.
We establish the soundness of the type inference algorithm and
show that the key steps of constraint-generation and constraint-solving
in the type inference algorithm are complete.

% while facilitating the reuse of existing C\# libraries with no modifications.
% Experiments demonstrate the practical utility of our approach.
